**[Navigating the World as a Context-Driven Tester](./navigatingcdt.md)** provides responses to common questions and statements about testing from a context-driven perspective.

The book will be a particularly useful resource for those new to context-driven testing, akin to an FAQ for day-to-day situations and how to approach them. It will also serve as a reference guide, with answers linking out to broader and deeper information on each topic.

The book is coordinated and collated by testing practitioner and long-standing AST member Dr Lee Hawkins, using input from both AST members and the broader testing community.
