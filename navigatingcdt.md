<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

_Navigating the World as a Context-Driven Tester_ provides responses to common questions and statements about testing from a context-driven perspective.

The book will be a particularly useful resource for those new to context-driven testing, akin to an FAQ for day-to-day situations and how to approach them. It will also serve as a reference guide, with answers linking out to broader and deeper information on each topic.

The book is coordinated and collated by testing practitioner and long-standing AST member Dr Lee Hawkins, using input from both AST members and the broader testing community via Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack and the AST mailing list. We are glad to provide an opportunity for testers to contribute to a useful reference piece and all contributions are [attributed](#contributors).

Our mission: _The [Association for Software Testing (AST)](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/) is dedicated to advancing the understanding of the science and practice of software testing according to Context-Driven principles._

We are an international non-profit professional association with members in over 50 countries. We strive to build a testing community that views the role of testing as skilled, relevant, and essential to the production of faster, better, and less expensive software products. We value a scientific approach to developing and evaluating techniques, processes, and tools. We believe that a self-aware, self-critical attitude is essential to understanding and assessing the impact of new ideas on the practice of testing.
