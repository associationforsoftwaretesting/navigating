<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

_needs work_
Navigating the World as a Context-Driven Tester provides responses to common questions and statements about testing from a context-driven perspective.

The book will be a particularly useful resource for those new to context-driven testing, akin to an FAQ for day-to-day situations and how to approach them. It will also serve as a reference guide, with answers linking out to broader and deeper information on each topic.

The book is coordinated and collated by testing practitioner and long-standing AST member Dr Lee Hawkins, using input from both AST members and the broader testing community.

Our mission: _The [Association for Software Testing (AST)](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/) is dedicated to advancing the understanding of the science and practice of software testing according to Context-Driven principles._

We are an international non-profit professional association with members in over 50 countries. We strive to build a testing community that views the role of testing as skilled, relevant, and essential to the production of faster, better, and less expensive software products. We value a scientific approach to developing and evaluating techniques, processes, and tools. We believe that a self-aware, self-critical attitude is essential to understanding and assessing the impact of new ideas on the practice of testing.
